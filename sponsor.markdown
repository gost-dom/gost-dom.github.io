# Sponsoring

This project need support if it is to become a complete mature usable project.

- A small or large contribution, one-time or recurring, as a token of gratitude.
- A significant recurring contribution to financially support further
development.

### Supporting development

Good karma cannot secure my livelyhood, and I will need to take paid assignments
to secure my personal finances.

This is a very ambitious project, and has seen good progress due to a lot of
spare time, but without financial help, continued development is unlikely.

Both in regards to implementing relevant missing features, as well as updating
as new web standards become available.

## Means of sponsoring

- [Github sponsors](https://github.com/stroiman)
- [Buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/stroiman)

Alternatively, I can send a formal invoice if you want to sponsor as a company.
